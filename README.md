- This website is designed to test the user's knowledge among beloved family and friends. It is simple, easy, fast and responsive for all devices. The questions in the quiz are suitable for all ages from 15 years old.

## Table of Contents

## UX

### Project Goals

In the first phase of planning the website, an attempt was made to address the age group between 15 and 55.

The website was designed to appeal to youth and adults. The questions and answers contain information that fits the wide range of ages that will play the quiz.

The website offers a challenge to determine your level of knowledge.

### Design Choices

#### Strategy Plane

- The core of the site is that you can test your knowledge. Easy to play quiz for teenagers and adults.

#### Scope / Structure / Skeleton Planes

- The site would contain a very minimalist landing page, with a simple logo in the centre and two buttons, the play button to start the quiz and a high score button to display previous high scores.

- The second page (the gameor quiz page) contains a progress bar at the top left that shows the number of questions answered by the user, the score area at the top right that shows the score that increases by 100 points for each correct answer, and the main quiz question in the centre with four choices.

- The last page (the score page) contains the score the user has achieved, including a container to save the score to the leaderboard, a button to play again, and a button to return.

- When designing the skeleton layer, care was taken to ensure that the user would only ever find a maximum of 4 clickable options on the screen. This was done so that the website is always intuitive and easy to navigate.


#### Surface Plane


#### Colors

- The colors of the website were chosen to make the user feel calm and excited when taking the quiz. The colors were also carefully chosen to be pleasing to the eyes.

- The colors were chosen as a palette from coolors.co  url :(https://coolors.co/125cff-e1f709-0066ff-f0dd06-ffffff)

- The colors were converted from HEX to RGB by the help of : (https://www.rgbtohex.net/)

### Manual Testing

view my manual testing document [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yK2xh-um0VA60lIJykqA4DKMP3xc3eXI-6a51qkb30U/edit#gid=0).  



### Defects of Note

1- Lighthouse audits repeatedly fail because of the bright color contrast between the first gradient of the buttons and the text color.

 By working on these sites that helped me very much i was able to find a match :
 https://cssgradient.io/
 https://coolors.co/u/wael_ghandoura
 
 2- The game question looks too big on mobile devices. 
 Adding the correct media queries solved the problem.
 
 3- The game gave a 404.html error on github, while it worked fine on gitpod.
 Adding the correct hrefs solved the problem.
