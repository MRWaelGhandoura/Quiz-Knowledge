- This website is designed to test the user's knowledge among beloved family and friends. It is simple, easy, fast and responsive for all devices. The questions in the quiz are suitable for all ages from 15 years old.

## Table of Contents

## UX

### Project Goals

In the first phase of planning the website, an attempt was made to address the age group between 15 and 55.

The website was designed to appeal to youth and adults. The questions and answers contain information that fits the wide range of ages that will play the quiz.

The website offers a challenge to determine your level of knowledge.

### Design Choices

#### Strategy Plane

- The core of the site is that you can test your knowledge. Easy to play quiz for teenagers and adults.

#### Scope / Structure / Skeleton Planes

- The site would contain a very minimalist landing page, with a simple logo in the centre and two buttons, the play button to start the quiz and a high score button to display previous high scores.

- The second page (the gameor quiz page) contains a progress bar at the top left that shows the number of questions answered by the user, the score area at the top right that shows the score that increases by 100 points for each correct answer, and the main quiz question in the centre with four choices.

- The last page (the score page) contains the score the user has achieved, including a container to save the score to the leaderboard, a button to play again, and a button to return.

- When designing the skeleton layer, care was taken to ensure that the user would only ever find a maximum of 4 clickable options on the screen. This was done so that the website is always intuitive and easy to navigate.


#### Surface Plane


#### Colors

- The colors of the website were chosen to make the user feel calm and excited when taking the quiz. The colors were also carefully chosen to be pleasing to the eyes.

- The colors were choosen as a palette from coolors.co  url :(https://coolors.co/125cff-e1f709-0066ff-f0dd06-ffffff)

- The colors were converted from HEX to RGB by the help of : (https://www.rgbtohex.net/)



#### Typography

- Font styles and sizes were chosen to be readable and easy on eyes from url: (https://fonts.google.com/)

#### Images

- Icons are used to make the website more realistic, give it some style and show the user more visual elements.
- Icons are adapted from url : (https://fontawesome.com/)

#### Animations and Transitions

- All buttons on the website were given special hovering effects. A mixture of scaling and box shadowing was used to make the buttons look like the neon lights in an arcade.

### Wireframes

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in a separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser. 

Wireframes can be as simple as a picture of a drawing of how you envisioned laying out the information for you pages in desktop, tablet and mobile views. They are a roadmap and do not have to be 100% accurate of the final product.

#### Future Features

- In the future I would like to add a music button so the user can enjoy the quiz.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Cross Browser and Cross Device Testing
Create a table that lists out what devices, browsers, and operating system you tested your application on and a brief description of why you chose the mixture you did. The point is to prove that you looked at the site across various browsers, operating systems, and viewport breakpoints.

| TOOL / Device                 | BROWSER     | OS         | SCREEN WIDTH  |
|-------------------------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| real phone: motog6            | chrome      | android    | XS 360 x 640  |
| browser stack: iPhone5s       | safari      | iOs        | XS 320 x 568  |
| dev tools emulator: pixel 2   | firefox     | android    | SM 411 x 731  |
| browserstack: iPhone 10x      | Chrome      | iOs        | SM 375 x 812  |
| browserstack: nexus 7 - vert  | Chrome      | android    | M 600 x 960   |
| real tablet: ipad mini - vert | safari      | iOs        | M 768 x 1024  |
| browserstack: nexus 7 - horiz | firefox     | android    | LG 960 x 600  |
| chrome emulator: ipad - horiz | safari      | iOs        | LG 1024 x 768 |
| browserstack                  | Chrome      | windows    | XL 1920 x 946 |
| real computer: mac book pro   | safari 12.1 | Mohave     | XL 1400 x 766 |
| browserstack                  | IE Edge 88  | windows 10 | XL 1920 x 964 |

### Manual Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. 

There are 3 ways you can document your testing:

**1. Markdown**

Describing your testing process is via scenarios, right here such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

**2. Use Spreadsheets**    

Here is a [Manual Testing Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vc1IVL-ydQwWeWMqnk_GRox6HE6qxDLpchGse8Crayo/edit#gid=296578096) that you can use as a starting point to keep track of your testing efforts. Make a copy of it in your own account and update as needed to reflect the browsers you are testing and features.  

**3.Use Github Agile Tools**

Create Custom Issue Template and A Pojrect Board in git hub.[Here's a brief overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDS5tZeMO77Dfq85IZGMSV6C41XaPm9FwcpR3k-UTVc/edit?usp=sharing) I put together on how to do this

It's ok to spot check specific functionality across devices and browsers but each page should be viewed as a whole for each device/browser combo at least once too.

A quick way to check if items are exceeding the screen width of a project is to run this javascript in the console for various screen emulations:

```
var docWidth = document.documentElement.offsetWidth;
[].forEach.call(document.querySelectorAll('*'),function(el){if(el.offsetWidth > docWidth){console.log(el);}});
```

### Defect Tracking

You should mention  any  bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
Again there are 3 different ways to do this, by your final project you should be using git hub tools.

**1. Markdown**

Desribe the issue in markdown. Include steps to reproduce, then what you did to resolve it.

1. Contact form allows anything for email collection, even blank.
   1. added pattern to HTML to make it have at least one character then the @ sybmol then a least one character and the . sign and at least one - 3 characters at the end.

**2. Use Spreadsheets**

Here is a [Defect Tracking Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tYB4X4wTCNEW_Y1no3hsGbclh2bLokl_I5Ev3s5EuJA/edit?usp=sharing) you use as a starting point to track defects. Make a copy of the sheet to your own account and update the Features sheet to match your project. 

**3. Use Github Agile Tools**

Create Custom Issue Template and a milestone in git hub.[Here's a brief overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDS5tZeMO77Dfq85IZGMSV6C41XaPm9FwcpR3k-UTVc/edit?usp=sharing) I put together on how to do this.

### Defects of Note
Some defects are more pesky than others. Highlight 3-5 of the bugs that drove you the most nuts and how you finally ended up resolving them.


### Outstanding Defects
It's ok to not resolve all the defects you found. If you know of something that isn't quite right, list it out and explain why you chose not to resolve it.

## Credits


### Content

The quiz questions and answers were taken from the following websites:
- 

### Media

Make a list of sites you used images from. If you used several sites try to match up each image to the correct site. This includes attribution for icons if they came from font awesome or other sites, give them credit.

### Acknowledgments

This is the section where you refer to code examples, mentors, blogs, stack overflow answers and videos that helped you accomplish your end project. Even if it's an idea that you updated you should note the site and why it was important to your completed project.

If you used a CodeInstitute Example project as a starting point. Make note of that here.
